# ProgInC
Notes on Programming in C (not including my written notes, just the code).

This now contains examples of code from lectures in programming in C.
The basics of the C language, as well as some essentials topics, such as memory allocation, pointers, the pre-processor, head files, macros etc are also included.
This is really just for me to test out github more than anything else.
